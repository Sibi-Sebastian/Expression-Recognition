# Expression-Recognition

This is a Python application that makes use of advanced Deep Learning techniques, using the FER library, to detect emotions in real-time from the webcam feeds, uploaded images, or videos. This project is provisioned to recognize and display emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and so on, with a high degree of accuracy.

 Some principal features of this application are: 

Webcam Emotion Detection: Detecting emotions in real-time from the webcam feed.
Image Upload Emotion Detection: This feature detects emotions through an uploaded image.
Video Upload Emotion Detection: It detects emotions through the emotions expressed in a video upload.
Live Emotion Detection: This is a feature that can continuously detect emotion without the need to capture images, thus providing real-time feedback while emotions change.

The application is built using Streamlit, a powerful and easy-to-use framework for creating interactive web applications with Python. This has helped us quickly develop a friendly user interface that enables seamless interaction and instant update functionality to the application.

Technical Details:
The emotion detection feature is powered by a pre-trained deep learning model of the FER library.
OpenCV: This library is used to capture and process videos in real-time, processing frames as images.
Streamlit: This library is used for the development of the web interface and handling user interactions.
Python: The whole application is coded in Python, utilizing powerful libraries and tools for machine learning and web development.
The project attests to the potential of AI in making human-computer interactions better and providing insight into human emotions. It finds applications in enhancing user experiences within software and in emotional analytics in many more areas.
